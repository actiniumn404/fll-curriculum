    <quiz-mc-question >
        Which of these statements about gears is true?
        <quiz-option>
            A gear train can increase both speed and torque at the same time.

        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option correct>
            If you increase the speed of a gear train, you will decrease its torque.

    <quiz-mc-question >
        Why is it important to know the difference between a driver gear and a driven gear?
        <quiz-option>
            The driver gear is always bigger than the driven gear.
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>

        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option correct>
            The driver gear is the input, and the driven gear is the output.
