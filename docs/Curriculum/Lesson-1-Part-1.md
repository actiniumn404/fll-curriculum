# Lesson 1, Part 1: Introduction to SPIKE
{: .no_toc }

In this lesson, we’ll explore the LEGO Spike Prime kit and learn the basics of what makes a robot work. You’ll get introduced to the key parts of the kit, the sensors and their functions, the hub (the robot’s “brain”), and how block coding brings it all together.

    <quiz-mc-question >
        Imagine you want your robot to stop when it bumps into a wall. Which sensor would you use and why?
        <quiz-option >
            Distance sensor, because it can sense pressure when touching a wall
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option correct>
            Force sensor, because it can detect when it is pressed against a surface
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option>
            Color sensor, because it detects changes in brightness
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option>
            Large motor, because it controls stopping movement

    </quiz-mc-question>

    <quiz-mc-question >
        If you want your robot to follow a black line on a white mat, which sensor should you use and how?
        <quiz-option>
            Distance sensor, since it can tell when the robot is at the wall
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option correct>
            Color sensor, to detect light vs. dark and guide the robot
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option>
            Force sensor, to sense when the robot is pressing against the mat
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option>

        </quiz-option>
    </quiz-mc-question>

    <quiz-mc-question>
        Which best explains why coding is compared to giving “instructions” to a robot?
        <quiz-option correct>
            Robots can only act if they are told exactly what to do
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option>
            Robots understand human language naturally
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option>
            Coding works like sensors detecting touch
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option>
            Instructions are optional for simple robots
