## Quiz
<content-quiz>
    <quiz-mc-question >
        A team has a very reliable but slow attachment. Which mission grouping strategy would be best for them to use to maximize their score and why?
        <quiz-option>
            Location-Based Grouping, because it minimizes travel time and reduces the risk of errors between missions.
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option >
            Task-Based Grouping, because it allows the team to focus on one type of robot action per run.
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option correct >
            If you increase the torque of a gear train, you will also increase its speed.
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option>
            A gear train can only increase speed, not torque.

    </quiz-mc-question>

    <quiz-mc-question >
        When a team is planning their runs, why is it a good idea to complete easier, high-point missions first?
        <quiz-option >
            Because the missions get harder as the competition goes on.
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option correct>
            To make sure you get a reliable score on the scoreboard right away.
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option>
            So you have more time for the other runs.       
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option>
            Because easy missions always have the highest point value.

    </quiz-mc-question>

    <quiz-mc-question >
        A team designs an attachment that can both lift and drop an object, as well as push it. This is an example of what design principle?
        <quiz-option>
            Reliability
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option >
            Simplicity
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option >
            Modularity  
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option correct>
            Multi-functionality
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
    </quiz-mc-question>

    <quiz-mc-question >
        Why is a modular robot a good idea for an FLL team?
        <quiz-option >
            It has fewer parts and is less likely to break.
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option >
            It allows you to use a single attachment for all missions.
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option >
            It makes the robot faster.
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option correct>
            It allows you to quickly swap attachments for different missions.

    <quiz-mc-question>
        Why is the K.I.S.S. Rule—"Keep It Simple, Students"—so important in FLL robotics?
        <quiz-option correct>
            Simple designs are easier to build, test, and repair under pressure.
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option >
            Simple designs are always more powerful than complex ones.
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option>
            Simple designs get more points from the judges.
            <quiz-explanation></quiz-explanation>
        </quiz-option>
        <quiz-option >
            Complex designs are not allowed in FLL.
