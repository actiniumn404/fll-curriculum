We are super glad to hear that you decided to transition to FTC, and we believe that this program will truly impact and transform your kids. We are happy to help in any way, shape, or form, so feel free to continue to reach out throughout the process!


Here is some advice that we have for commonly asked questions:

## Things that we should (or better to) procure through FIRST Inspire

The first primary step would be to finalize your team members, coaches, and mentors so that you can register the team on FIRST Inspires. Guide to FTC Rookie Registration. If you need, we can definitely hold a meeting and walk through this with you if you need guidance. We also suggest you begin training your team members and purchase important parts such as the REV Control Hubs, motors, etc. from FTC vendors. Other steps that you can take would include fundraising and learning about the different components of FTC (so that you can make it easier for you during the season).


## What things should a rookie team need to have and places (recommendations) to buy them from?

REV Control Hub, legal Android Phone, batteries, motors + sensors (we personally use GoBilda, but GoBilda, Actorobotics, and REV are all common vendors), REV power switch, tool kit, some channels, etc.


## Is there something called a starter kit? If so, would your team recommend that for a rookie team?

The starter kits in FTC don't really help as much as the kit does in FLL. We recommend buying parts from the vendors directly. However, the GoBilda mecanum drivetrain kit is a great place to start for rookie teams!


## Is there a different type of electronic set allowed for FTC, if so, what are those, and which one your team would recommend?

The legal electronic set includes a REV control hub + Android Phone (or REV expansion hub and 2 phones, but we recommend the control hub), REV battery, and REV power switch. Other electronics are based on your team's preference and can be found [on the official FIRST website](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/legal-illegal-parts-list.pdf).


## I understand the game field size 12' X 12', but do we need that much space for practice? If not, what is the field size recommended for practice?

Nope, you definitely don't need the entire field. FTC has a half-field option which would work great for your team! When you purchase the field off AndyMark, you can select "partial field."


## Can the field mat be any mat, or should we get it from some approved vendor?

The field has to have specific [official soft tiles](https://www.andymark.com/products/soft-tiles-for-first-tech-challenge-field-options?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6Ok5hdmlnYXRpb246OlNlYXJjaFJlc3VsdHMvJTdCJTIycSUyMiUzQSUyMmZ0YyttYXQlMjIlN0Q).


## Tools/programming language that the team should get familiar with?

Even though block programming is an option many teams use, we recommend using Java-based programming to increase your flexibility.


## Anything that the team can prepare/look into at this time?

Your team has the advantage of starting early in the summer! We recommend that you utilize this time to train your team members and conduct a few outreach events. Giving the students hands-on experience will serve extremely valuable during this time.
